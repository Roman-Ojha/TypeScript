-> here we had added the html and css for the tutorial project
-> To Compile Typescript to javascript Run:
    -> tsc sandbox.ts sandbox.js
        -> tsc (Typescript Compile)
        -> sandbox.tx (from)
        -> sandbox.js (to)
    -> but if we want to compile Typescript having same file name as javascript file name then we can just run:
        -> tsc sandbox.ts

    -> right now we have to recompile code again and again when we change our .ts file, so now run:
        -> tsc sandbox.ts -w
            -> -w (watch flag)
