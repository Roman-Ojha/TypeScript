*) What is TypeScript?
    -> Alternative to Javascript(superset)
    -> Allows us to use strict types
    -> Supports modern features(arrow function,let, const)
    -> Extra feature(generics, interfaces, tuples etc)
    -> we write code on TypeScript but it will compile down to javascript to understand by browser
    -> Javascript is a dynamic types language which leads application to have much more error because the type of that variable could change on the runtime

*) Setup:
    -> need to install nodeJS
    -> npm install -g typescript
